# fabric-suite

Personal [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) setup for managing Moodle servers.

The scripts here have pieces that are very specific to the servers I run. I'm
mainly uploading it to GitHub for safekeeping and to demonstrate what a
well-organized Fabric setup looks like. This is pretty minimal so far - I don't
have roles or groups of servers, nor any need for that sort of thing yet.

Please don't look at any of the regexes.
